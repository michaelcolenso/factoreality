# factoreality

A fully autonomous agentic pipeline that turns a product spec into a finished,
downloadable digital knowledge product — with zero human intervention between
kickoff and delivery.

Write the spec. Hit run. Come back to a finished product.

---

## What it produces

Any packaged digital knowledge product: ebooks, template packs, mini-courses,
worksheet bundles, checklist systems, swipe file collections, resource guides,
or data-driven reports.

## How it works

A sequential 6-stage pipeline coordinated by an orchestrator agent, with a
dedicated QA Reviewer agent that replaces the human at every milestone gate.

```
Spec → Plan → Research → Outline → Draft → Editorial → Format → Package
             Gate 0    Gate 1    Gate 2   Gate 3      Gate 4    Gate 5   Gate 6
```

Every gate scores the stage output on a structured rubric (0.0–1.0). Scores
below the threshold trigger targeted REVISE feedback (up to N retries). After
max retries, the pipeline halts cleanly with a diagnostic — never ships a
product that failed its gates.

## Quick start

### 1. Install

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Requires Python 3.11+ and an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable.

Pandoc + XeLaTeX are optional but enable PDF export (Stage 5).

### 2. Provide input (choose one path)

**Path A — Manual spec (most control)**

```bash
cp templates/spec_template.md spec.md
# Edit spec.md — be obsessively specific.
```

**Path B — Brief-driven bootstrap (fastest start)**

```bash
cp templates/brief_template.md product-brief.md
# Edit product-brief.md
python orchestrator.py . --brief-file product-brief.md
```

The pipeline still runs against `spec.md` as its source of truth. In Path B,
`spec.md` is generated for you before Gate 0.

### 3. Run

```bash
python orchestrator.py .
```

Or from a different directory:

```bash
python orchestrator.py /path/to/project
```

Options:
- `--dry-run` — validate spec and plan without making LLM calls
- `--resume`  — continue from the last completed stage after a halt
- `--brief "..."` — generate `spec.md` from a short product brief, then run
- `--brief-file path/to/brief.md` — same as `--brief`, reading from a file
- `--regenerate-spec` — force re-generation of `spec.md` from the brief

Notes:
- Existing `spec.md` is reused by default.
- Use `--regenerate-spec` with `--brief` or `--brief-file` to overwrite `spec.md`.
- `--resume` continues from `status.md` and does not require regenerating `spec.md`.

### 4. Collect output

When complete, check `output/` for deliverables and `status.md` for the
full audit log of every gate, score, decision, and retry.

## Quality gates

| Gate | Stage | Key checks |
|------|-------|------------|
| 0 | Plan | Covers all spec deliverables, word counts sum correctly |
| 1 | Research | ≥10 sources, competitive matrix, sourced pain points |
| 2 | Outline | Section count in range, word allocations sum to spec |
| 3 | Draft | No placeholders, word count on target, all sections present |
| 4 | Editorial | No grammar errors, readability on target, facts verified |
| 5 | Formatting | Files parse without errors, TOC matches headings |
| 6 | Assembly | Every spec deliverable exists, all files open, manifest accurate |

Default quality threshold: **0.80** (configurable per run in spec.md).

Gate 6 is PASS/FAIL only — no REVISE at the final gate.

---

## Supported product types

| Type | Default threshold |
|------|------------------|
| ebook | 0.85 |
| template-pack | 0.80 |
| worksheet-bundle | 0.80 |
| mini-course | 0.85 |
| resource-guide | 0.80 |
| report | 0.90 |

## Cost model (February 2026)

Rough estimates per run for a 15,000-word ebook:

| Component | Approx. cost |
|-----------|-------------|
| Research | $3–8 |
| Outline | $1–2 |
| Content generation | $5–15 |
| Editorial QA | $3–8 |
| Formatting | $2–5 |
| QA Reviewer (6 gates) | $5–12 |
| Retries (avg 2/run) | $2–5 |
| **Total** | **~$22–55** |
| Human time | $0 |

## Design

See the full architecture document: [The Content Factory v0.2](https://github.com/michaelcolenso/factoreality)

Key design decisions:

- **Separate QA Reviewer agent** — distinct model call, distinct prompt, fresh
  context at every gate. Self-review doesn't work; a separate reviewer catches
  errors the writer normalizes.
- **Durable file stack** — all state lives in files (spec, plan, implement,
  status), not in context windows. Any agent can resume from any point.
- **Decision locking** — the outline is frozen after Gate 2. No structural
  drift in downstream stages.
- **Stop-and-fix rule** — failures are repaired before proceeding. Errors never
  accumulate across milestones.
- **Cascading failure prevention** — permanent stage failure halts the pipeline
  cleanly. No partial products ship.
